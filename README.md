# Item_base_Recommendation_System


 ## Project Overview

This project implements an Item-Based Collaborative Filtering recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset
.
Unlike user-based systems, this model focuses on similarities between items (movies) rather than users.
If two movies receive similar ratings from many users, the system considers them related — and recommends one when the other is watched or liked.

 ## Project Objectives

- To understand the core logic behind item-based collaborative filtering

-To explore similarity metrics (correlation, cosine similarity, etc.)

- To generate personalized movie recommendations

- To build a modular and reproducible recommendation workflow
